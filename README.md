# Monkey Files
#### File Explorer the way I want it.
### What I Want
1. Create new directory
2. Create a file
3. Search for a file or folder 
### What's Been Implemented
1. Display what's in a directory
2. Return contents of a directory
3. Get new path from a string
### What I might change
1. Return a vector of PathBufs instead of Strings? (WBI 2)
## When I think the main file explorer functionality is complete
1. Start moving towards gui
2. Start looking at access to local network
3. Start looking at transferring files or directories to other computers
